    <h1>Piano man</h1>
    <text class="Author">~ Billy Joel ~</text>
    <p>It's nine o'clock on a Saturday</p>
    <p>The regular crowd shuffles in</p> 
    <p>There's an old man sittin' next to me</p> 
    <p>Makin' love to his tonic and gin</p> 
    <p>He says, "Son can you play me a memory?</p> 
    <p>I'm not really sure how it goes</p> 
    <p>But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete</p> 
    <p>When I wore a younger man's clothes"</p> 
    <p>La, la-la, di-di-da</p> 
    <p>La-la di-di-da da-dum</p> 
    <p>Sing us a song, you're the piano man</p> 
    <p>Sing us a song tonight</p> 
    <p>Well, we're all in the mood for a melody</p> 
    <p>And you've got us feelin' alright</p> 
    <p>Now John at the bar is a friend of mine</p> 
    <p>He gets me my drinks for free</p> 
    <p>And he's quick with a joke, or to light up your smoke</p> 
    <p>But there's some place that he'd rather be</p> 
    <p>He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me"</p> 
    <p>As a smile ran away from his face</p> 
    <p>"Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star</p> 
    <p>If I could get out of this place"</p> 
    <p>Oh, la, la-la, di-di-da</p> 
    <p>La-la di-di-da da-dum</p> 
    <p>Now Paul is a real estate novelist</p> 
    <p>Who never had time for a wife</p> 
    <p>And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the navy</p> 
    <p>And probably will be for life</p> 
    <p>And the waitress is practicing politics</p> 
    <p>As the businessmen slowly get stoned</p> 
    <p>Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness</p> 
    <p>But it's better than drinkin' alone</p> 
    <p>Sing us the song, you're the piano man</p> 
    <p>Sing us a song tonight</p> 
    <p>Well, we're all in the mood for a melody</p> 
    <p>And you've got us feelin' alright</p> 
    <p>It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday</p> 
    <p>And the manager gives me a smile</p> 
    <p>'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see</p> 
    <p>To forget about life for a while</p> 
    <p>And the piano, it sounds like a carnival</p> 
    <p>And the microphone smells like a beer</p> 
    <p>And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar</p> 
    <p>And say man what are you doin' here?</p> 
    <p>Oh, la, la-la, di-di-da</p> 
    <p>La-la di-di-da da-dum</p> 
    <p>Sing us the song, you're the piano man</p> 
    <p>Sing us a song tonight</p> 
    <p>Well, we're all in the mood for a melody</p> 
    <p>And you've got us feelin' alright</p>
